# HR_Dashboard_Tableau_Project
 A Complete HR Tableau Practice Project End-to-End - Using Youtube Video From "Data With Baraa" - Youtube Link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcGF09Awm4Y

 You can use the Chat_gpt prompt from "Chat_gpt_prompt_to_create_Faker_data.txt" file to generate the Code which can be used to generate the fake HR dataset.

 Chatgpt code is available in "code_to_generate_faker_data.py". (It was generated in my Chat gpt using the provided prompts. It may be different from Data with Baraa Code).

 But for Tableau dashboard, I am using "HumanResources.csv" file, which was given in downloadable data file -  "Tableau-HR-Project-Materials.zip". (Refer "DOWNLOAD_REQUIRED_DATA_FILES_FROM_HERE.md" file)
